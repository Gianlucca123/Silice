# Silice build scripts for the ULX3SThe ULX3S is a great board to experiment with Silice. Most projects build for the ULX3S, including the doomchip, wolfpga and all VGA demos.The ULX3S has on-board SDRAM, so you are all set for projects requiring RAM. For graphical projects you will however need either an OLED/LCD screen ora [VGA DAC](../../DIYVGA.md). See links below for a selection of OLED/LCD screens.(I have yet to produce a HDMI output example, this is on the TODO!)## Building a projectAs an example, building the doomchip for an OLED screen:1) plug the ULX3S2) run ```./ulx3s_bare_64.sh ../../doomchip/oled_doomchip.ice```(see also project README)Another example is the SDCARD test:1) plug the ULX3S2) run ```./ulx3s_bare_64.sh ../../oled_sdcard_test/oled_sdcard_test.ice```(see also project README)## OLED/LCD screensScreens using a ST7789 or SSD1351 drivers are supported by the OLED library (```common/oled.ice```).For the ULX3S, some small 240x240 LCD screens directly fit on the connector (the one rightbelow the FPGA, you may have to solder a connector to the board).
