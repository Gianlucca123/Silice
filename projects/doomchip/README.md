# The DooM-chip

*It will run Doom forever*

## Foreword

This is very much a work in progress, and Silice has evolved together with the DooM-chip. Therefore the code is not always using of the latest language niceties.

More importantly, it is slow compared to what it should be, essentially because the main loop is naively sequential. This will be soon improved and optimized (resulting in a much more elegant code!), but the focus was first and foremost on make it happen!

The DooM-chip is also a great example of what the Lua pre-processor has to offer. Indeed, the pre-processor automatically parses the game file data, extracts and generates all datastructures that are then embedded into brams/broms.

## Where's All the Data?

For obvious copyright reasons you have to provide your own Doom WAD file. During compilation the data will be automatically extracted and processed. You can select the level in the header of *vga_doomchip.ice* (see the "ExMy" string).

The DooM-chip also works with WAD files from the [freedoom project](https://freedoom.github.io/).

## How to test in simulation

Open a shell, go to *Silice/projects/build/verilator* and then type in
```./verilator_sdram_vga.sh ../../doomchip/vga_doomchip.ice```

Images will be produced in the directory, the third one (*vgaout_0002.tga*) should reveal a view of E1M1! (the two first are black as this corresponds to memory and chip reset/warmup).

## Running on real hardware

The Doom-chip has been tested on the following boards:

### ULX3S with OLED screen

The default is a ST7789 240x240 screen ; these are innexpensive (~ $6) and some models plug directly into the OLED connector of the ULX3S (you'll have to solder the connector if not present, it is located just below the ECP5).

The OLED library supports also an SSD1351 driver, and other resolutions, but you'll have to edit the source code to customize for that (easy, there are variables for that in headers).

Go into the projects/build/ulx3s directory, plug the board to USB and run
```./ulx3s_bare.sh ../../doomchip/oled_doomchip.ice```

Done! (takes ~ 0.5 hour)

Note: under Windows make sure you use the toolchain compiled for 64 bits (MinGW64) as compilation allocates more than 4GB of RAM.

### ULX3S with VGA DAC

For this one you need a VGA DAC, see [instructions here](../DIYVGA.md).

Then, enter the projects/build/ulx3s directory, plug the board to USB and run
```./ulx3s_sdram_vga.sh ../../doomchip/vga_doomchip.ice```

### de10-nano with VGA DAC and SDRAM

The target platform is a de10-nano board equipped with SDRAM, a VGA DAC and (for now) a 4x4 keypad matrix. 
The SDRAM uses the exact same setup as the [MiSTEr projet](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) (see instructions there). You also need a VGA DAC, see [instructions here](../DIYVGA.md).

I cannot provide a pre-built image for programming the FPGA as it would include game data, so you'll have to compile the entire thing -- but that is a good way
to get started!

Basically you have to
1. Generate the Verilog code into the de10nano projet, see [README in projects/build/de10nano](../build/de10nano/README.md)
1. Launch Quartus and start synthesis
1. Wait for a relatively long time 
1. Program the de10nano using Quartus programmer!

The amound of texture data can be controlled from the header of 'pre_do_textures.lua'. The more you use, the slower synthesis is (and of course the design may not fit).
