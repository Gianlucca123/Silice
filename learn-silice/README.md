# Learn FPGA programming with Silice

## What do you need?

This series of tutorials works with any of the following boards: IceStick, IceBreaker, ULX3S. (*Note:* and on many other boards with minimal changes). 

The IceStick and IceBreaker are great first options. The IceStick is small (1280 LUTs) but can still host many cool projects (all Silice [VGA demos](../projects/vga_demo) as well as Silice [tiny Ice-V RISC-V processor](../projects/ice-v) work on it!). The IceBreaker is ~5 times larger (5280 LUTs) and offers a lot more connectivity. The ULX3S is great for both simple and advanced projects.

The first parts of the tutorial require only the boards, while the second part explores using a few peripherals: OLED screen, matrix LED panel, VGA. 

## What will you learn?

We will cover the following topics, each introducing new concepts of Silice:
- (*coming soon*) blinking LEDs (the *Hello world* of FPGA)
- (*coming soon*) UART communication
- (*Coming soon*) OLED screens
- (*Coming soon*) matrix LED panel
- (*Coming soon*) VGA
