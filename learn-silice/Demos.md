# Silice by example: demos and code walkthroughs

This page references demos, tutorials and code walkthrough that are in the `projects` directory. Many have detailed explanations and are thus a good resource for practical use cases of Silice.

## List

- [Blinky](blinky/README.md) explores variants of the *hello world* of FPGA with Silice. Provides an introduction to many basic elements of Silice. Read first!

The following demos are compatible with the IceStick and IceBreaker:
- [Ice-V RV32I RISC-V processor](../projects/ice-v/README.md)
- [VGA demos](../projects/vga_demo/README.md)

The terrain demo was designed for the IceBreaker:
- [Terrain](../projects/terrain/README.md)

The HDMI framework for the ULX3S:
- [HDMI framework](../projects/hdmi_test/README.md)

The DooM-chip demo revisits the Doom render loop in hardware (ULX3S):
